# üêâ Dragon Repeller - Turn-Based RPG Game

This is a simple turn-based battle RPG built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The player fights against various enemies (like fanged beasts and dragons) using different attacks and healing potions. The goal is to defeat all enemies and become the ultimate dragon repeller.

## What I Learned

This project helped me practice:
- Core JavaScript (variables, functions, arrays, conditionals, loops)
- DOM manipulation (changing content, hiding/showing elements)
- Game logic (turn-based mechanics, state changes)
- Basic front-end structure using existing HTML/CSS

I did **not** write the HTML or CSS files ‚Äî I focused on the **JavaScript game logic**.
